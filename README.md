# Little Taco Shop (HTML Only)

This project is a simple multi-page website built using **semantic HTML**.

## What I practiced
- Semantic HTML structure
- Accessible navigation
- Forms with proper labels
- Tables and lists
- Multi-page linking

## Pages
- Home
- Hours
- Contact

## Tech stack
- HTML5

## Notes
This project focuses on HTML structure only.
Styling will be added later when I learn CSS.
